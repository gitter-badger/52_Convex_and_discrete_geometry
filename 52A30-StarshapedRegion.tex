{\bf Definition}
A subset $U$ of a real (or possibly complex) vector space is called 
\emph{star-shaped} if there is a point $p\in U$ such that the line segment
$\overline{pq}$ is contained in $U$ for all $q\in U$. (Here, $\overline{pq} = \{ tp + (1-t)q\, | \, t\in[0,1] \}$.)  We then say that $U$ is star-shaped with respect to $p$.

In other \PMlinkescapetext{words}, a region $U$ is star-shaped if there is a point $p\in U$ such that $U$ can be ``collapsed'' or ``contracted'' \PMlinkescapetext{onto} $p$.

\subsubsection{Examples}
\begin{enumerate}
\item In $\sR^n$, any vector subspace is star-shaped. Also, the unit cube and 
unit ball are star-shaped, but the unit sphere is not. 
\item A subset $U$ of a vector space is star-shaped with respect to all of its points if and only if $U$ is convex. 
\end{enumerate}
