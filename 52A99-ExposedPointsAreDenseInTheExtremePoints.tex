\begin{defn}
Let $K \subset {\mathbb{R}}^n$ be a closed convex set.  A point $p \in K$ is called an {\em exposed}
point if there is an $n-1$ dimensional hyperplane whose intersection with $K$ is $p$ alone.
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}[Strasziewicz]
Let $K \subset {\mathbb{R}}^n$ be a closed convex set.  Then the set of exposed points is dense in the set
of extreme points.
\end{thm}

For example, let $C(p)$ denote the closed ball in ${\mathbb{R}}^2$ of radius 1 and centered at $p.$  Then take
$K$ to be the convex hull of $C(-1,0)$ and $C(1,0)$.  The points $(-1,1),$ $(-1,-1),$ $(1,1),$ and $(1,-1)$ are
extreme points, but they are not exposed points.
