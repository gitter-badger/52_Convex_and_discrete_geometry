For the first claim, it is obvious that $\bigcap_{i\in I}A_i$ is closed \PMlinkname{convex subset}{ConvexSet} of $K$. Let $z \in A$ and $0<t<1$, $x, y\in  K$ such as 
$z=tx+(1-t)y$. Then $z \in A_i$, for all $i\in I$ so we have that $x,y \in A_i$ for all $i\in I$. Therefore $x,y \in \bigcap_{i\in I}A_i.$
\\For the second claim suppose $x,y \in K$, $t\in(0,1)$ and  $z\in A$ such as $z=tx+(1-t)y$. From the hypothesis $A\subset B$ we have that 
$z\in B$ and since $B$ is an extreme subset of $K$, $x,y \in  B$. Analogously from the hypothesis that $A$ is an extreme subset of $B$, we have that $x,y \in A$.
