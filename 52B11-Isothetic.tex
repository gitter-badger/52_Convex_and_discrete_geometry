\begin{document}
A curve is {\em isothetic} if it consists entirely of lines parallel to one of the coordinate axes in a given rectilinear coordinate system.  A polygon or polyhedron is isothetic if all of its edges are parallel to one of the coordinate axes.

An example of an isothetic polygon is the rectangle $\{(x,y) : x_1 \le x \le x_2,\; y_1 \le y \le y_2\}$ for some $x_1$, $x_2$, $y_1$, $y_2$.  Examples of non-isothetic shapes are the tilted square $\{(x,y,z) : |x| + |y| = 1 \}$ and the bipyramid $\{(x,y,z) : |x|+|y|+|z|=1 \}$.

(This entry is here because I couldn't find a definition of isothetic on the web.  If you know anything interesting about isothetic shapes, please adopt this entry!)
