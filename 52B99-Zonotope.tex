A \emph{zonotope} is a polytope which can be obtained as the
\PMlinkname{Minkowski sum}{MinkowskiSum3} of finitely many 
closed line segments in $\mathbb{R}^n$.  Three-dimensional zonotopes are also sometimes called \emph{zonohedra}.  Zonotopes are dual to finite hyperplane arrangements.  They are centrally symmetric, compact, convex sets.

For example, the unit $n$-cube is the Minkowski sum of
the line segments from the origin to the standard unit vectors $e_i$ 
for $1\le i\le n$.  
A hexagon is also a zonotope; for example, the Minkowski 
sum of the line segments based at the origin with endpoints at $(1,0)$, $(1,1)$, and $(0,1)$ is a hexagon.  In fact, any projection of an $n$-cube is a zonotope.

The prism of a zonotope is always a zonotope, but the pyramid of a 
zonotope need not be.  In particular, the 
\PMlinkname{$n$-simplex}{HomologyTopologicalSpace} is only a
zonotope for $n\le 1$.
